# DOCUMENTATION: FAMILY TREE APPLICATION

## 1.WHAT IS IT? 
This Java console application demonstrates a simple family tree using a tree data structure.

## 2.WHAT IT CAN DO? 
The application uses a custom Person class to represent individuals in the family tree. Each Person object has a name and an ArrayList of Person objects called children. The root variable points to the topmost ancestor in the family tree. The addChild function creates a new Person object and adds it to the children list of the current person. The printTree function uses recursion to traverse the tree and display the names of each person with proper indentation to represent their hierarchical relationship.

## 3.WHY DID I MAKE THIS KIND OF APPLICATION? 
This application serves as a simple example of how tree data structures can be used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as family structures.
## 4.HOW DOES IT CONTRIBUTE TO YOU OR TO THECOMMUNITY?
This application can help beginners understand the concepts of tree data structures and their applications in a practical way. It can also be a starting point for building more complex applications that require hierarchical data organization.
